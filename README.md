# KCL BSc Computer Science Dissertation: WiFi Scanning Contact Tracing App with Flutter

This is the repository for my BSc Computer Science dissertation. The project is a contact tracing app for Android and iOS devices, which uses WiFi scanning to detect other devices in the vicinity. The app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA0oagBhDHARIsAI-BbgcqHbBzxXz-YcTWjxDOFmrfRnaDiAUyC3uQAZcuQtn2DyKEDDz1dpgaArdLEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), and the backend uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA0oagBhDHARIsAI-BbgcSqfvEEMi9Yo2qHmoOAHUpFuxDeHCiygXoSRxywUQOd21EdycfX_0aAtFoEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).

The final grade for the project is 75/100 (1:1).

## Report & Demo
The final report can be found [here](markdown_files/6CCS3PRJ_Final_Year_Dissertation.pdf), and the demo of the app is shown [here](markdown_files/app_demo.mp4).
